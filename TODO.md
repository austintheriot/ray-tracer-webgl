- Add comments/clarify glsl code
- Add loading indicator while fetching/compiling shader code
- Enable setting geometry from Rust side
  - Uniform buffer object?
- Enable mobile viewers to view
- Enable focal distance (increase aperture size), and have camera automatically focus whatever is immediately in sight
  - This will probably involve doing a single CPU ray-cast through the center of the canvas to find the first object that is hit
- Cleanup the data structures around setting uniforms and also adding ui listeners, etc.
- Enable velocity
- Only run update_pipeline once before actually rendering
- Limit aspect ratio of window? (to prevent performance issues on very large screens)
- Enable collision detection for camera (to prevent moving into bodies on accident)
