- Rename u, v, w to more human-readable names
- Provide error message for browsers that don't support webgl2
- Add loading indicator while fetching/compiling shader code
- Enable mobile viewers to view
- Enable focal distance (increase aperture size), and have camera automatically focus whatever is immediately in sight
  - This will probably involve doing a single CPU ray-cast through the center of the canvas to find the first object that is hit
- Cleanup the data structures around setting uniforms and also adding ui listeners, etc.
- Enable velocity
- Only run update_pipeline once before actually rendering
- Enable collision detection for camera (to prevent moving into bodies on accident)
